# ðŸ¤– LLM-Powered Autonomous Agent â€“ Startup Idea Validator

A lightweight, command-line autonomous agent that takes a raw startup idea, uses an LLM to break it down, enrich it with real-time web search, and generates a structured validation report â€” all in one run.

Built as a skills showcase project using OpenAI GPT-4 and external web search APIs. Inspired by AutoGPT/BabyAGI, but focused, interpretable, and deployable in under 5 minutes.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Purpose

This project demonstrates how an LLM can autonomously:
- Understand and deconstruct an abstract idea
- Identify the market, competitors, and unique angles
- Search the web for validation signals
- Produce a structured business insight report

Itâ€™s intended as a simple but impressive demo for AI and automation capabilities using agentic reasoning.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Python 3.9+** | Main language |
| **OpenAI GPT-3.5** | Core LLM used for reasoning and language understanding |
| **Serper.dev API** | Real-time Google Search API alternative |

## ðŸš€ How It Works

1. **User Input**: You provide a startup idea (e.g., *"An app that connects freelancers with NGOs based on cause alignment."*)
2. **Idea Parsing**: The agent uses GPT-3.5 to extract:
   - Solution type
   - Target user
   - Industry/domain
   - Key features
   - Keywords
3. **Search Tool Activation**: Using those keywords, it performs a web search (Google/Serper.dev)
4. **Report Generation**: The agent writes a concise report summarizing:
   - Market validation
   - Competitors
   - Suggested improvements
   - Risks and feasibility
